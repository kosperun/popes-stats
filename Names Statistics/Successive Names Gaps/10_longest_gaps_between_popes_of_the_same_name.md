Among the second popes in these pairs, only Marcellus II kept his birth name.  
  
In the 20th century, two popes chose names that had not been used for centuries:  
  
- John XXIII (1958) — the first “John” in 623 years since John XXII died in 1334, or 543 years since the deposition of the earlier John XXIII in 1415 (then considered legitimate, now classified as an antipope).  
  
- Paul VI (1963) — the first “Paul” in 342 years since Paul V died in 1621.
