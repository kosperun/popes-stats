# The Longest Gaps Between Popes (Sede Vacante)

Note: The analysis starts with Pope Pontian (230-235), after whose pontificate the exact dates of each pope’s reign are known.

There have been 8 periods of sede vacante (papal interregnums) lasting more than a year.

## Some historical notes  

- In the 7th century, popes were usually elected soon after the death of their predecessors, but their consecration required confirmation from the emperor in Constantinople, thus resulting in long but essentially formal sede vacante periods. For this reason, the 7th century records some of the lengthiest interregnums (10 years 171 days in total).  

- By contrast, the 13th century saw the longest real sede vacante interregnums (9 years 194 days in total), when papal elections dragged on for years due to political pressures and deep divisions among the cardinals.

- 1268–1271 marked the longest papal election in history. The election of Gregory X took place over a year after the magistrates of Viterbo confined the cardinals, reduced their rations to bread and water, and even removed the roof of the Palace of the Popes in Viterbo. During this protracted election, three of the twenty cardinal-electors died and one resigned. In response, Gregory X issued the papal bull Ubi periculum on 7 July 1274, during the Second Council of Lyon, establishing the papal conclave. Its rules were directly inspired by the measures used in Viterbo, and the first election conducted under these rules is often considered the first true conclave.

- Decades later, in the 1316 papal election, a similar crisis unfolded: after two years of deadlock, Philip, Count of Poitiers, summoned 23 cardinals to Lyon in August 1316, forbidding them from leaving until they had chosen a new pope.  

- The 1292–1294 election of Celestine V was the Catholic Church's last papal election conducted outside a formal conclave. After Pope Nicholas IV died in April 1292, the cardinals in Perugia were deadlocked for over two years. Pietro di Morrone, a Benedictine hermit known to the cardinals, warned them that divine vengeance would follow if they delayed. Finally, the aged and ill Dean of the College of Cardinals, Latino Malabranca, exclaimed, "In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, I elect brother Pietro di Morrone!" The cardinals ratified the decision. Pietro initially refused the papacy and even tried to flee, but he was eventually persuaded by a delegation of cardinals accompanied by the King of Naples.  

- The 15th century saw some of the shortest sede vacante periods, averaging just 15 days, if not for the disruptions caused by the Western Schism and the Council of Constance (1415–1417). During this period, Pope Gregory XII resigned, antipopes Alexander V and John XXIII were deposed, and Benedict XIII refused to step down until his eventual excommunication on 27 July 1417. Martin V was then elected on 11 November 1417.

## Other examples of long formal sede vacante from the 7th century where the pope-elect was not immediately confirmed by the emperors  

1. Severinus was elected pope in mid-October 638, just days after Honorius I died, but was not confirmed by the Exarch of Ravenna until 28 May 640 (1 year, 229 days), because Severinus refused to accept the Monothelite teaching.  

2. Leo II was elected on 16 April 681, three months after the death of Pope Agatho, but was not consecrated until 17 August 682 (1 year, 219 days). This delay may have been due to Agatho’s negotiations with Emperor Constantine IV regarding imperial control of papal elections.  

3. Boniface V was elected to succeed Adeodatus I after the latter’s death in November 618, but a sede vacante of 1 year and 45 days ensued before the election was ratified by the imperial government in Constantinople.  

## Zero-day interregnums

There were 18 instances of a zero-day gap, where the next pope was elected on the same day the previous pope died. Half of these occurred during the latter half of the 9th century and the first half of the 10th century (a period known as the Saeculum Obscurum). The conclave of 1198, which elected Innocent III on the very day Celestine III died, marks the last recorded instance of a zero-gap sede vacante.
