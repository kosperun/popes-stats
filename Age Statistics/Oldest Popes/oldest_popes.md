Gregory XII abdicated at around 88 years of age and lived for two more years, dying on October 18, 1417, aged 89–90. Had he not abdicated, he would have ranked higher on this list.
Benedict XVI abdicated at 85 and lived almost ten more years, passing away on December 31, 2022, at the age of 95. Without abdication, he would rank around 3rd place among the oldest popes (or 1st among those with fully confirmed ages.).
